are to be designed for IRC Class A loading.									
									
		GENERAL  IRC Class-A loading Pattern							
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
	The IRC Class A loading as per the drawing is severe and the same is to be considered as per 								
clauses 207.1.3&207.4									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
	The ground contact area of wheels for the above placement,each axle wise is								
given below:-									
									
	Axle load		Ground Contact Area						
	(Tonnes)		B(mm)	W(mm)					
									
	11.4		250	500					
	6.8		200	380					
	2.7		150	200					
									
									
	Assuming 0.3m allowance for guide posts and the clear distance of vehicle from 								
the edge of guide post being 0.15m as per clause 207.1,the value of 'f' shown in the figure will 									
be 0.45m									
									
	Hence,the width of area to be loaded with 7.25KN/m2 on left side is (f) =					0.45m			
	Similarly,the area to be loaded on right side (k) = 					3.25m			
						3.70m			
									
									
	The total live load on the deck slab composes the following components:-								
									
	1.Wheel loads----Point loads						296.00KN		
									
	2.Live load in remaing portion(Left side)----UDL						22.185KN		
									
	2.Live load in remaing portion(Right side)----UDL						160.225KN

	Distance of centroid of forces from x-axis								
									
									
 =	4.204m								
									
	Eccentricity   =		0.804m						
									
	Location of resultant is as shown below:-								
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
	Calculation of reactions on abutments:-								
									
	Reaction   due to loads Ra  =			182.64KN					
									
									
	Reaction due to point loads = Rb =			295.77KN					
									
									
	Hence,the critical reaction is Ra =			295.77KN					
									
	The corrected reaction  =			295.77KN					
									
	Assuming that the live load reaction acts at the centre of the contact area on the abutment,								
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
	The eccentricty of the line of action of live load   =					0.01m			
									
									
									
3.Impact of vehicles:-									
									
	As per Clause 211 of IRC:6--2000,impact allowance shall be made by an increment 								
of live load by a factor 4.5/(6+L)									
									
Hence,the factor is			0.352						
									
									
	Further as per clause 211.7 of IRC:6--2000,the above impact factor shall be only 								
50% for calculation of pressure on piers and abutments just below the level of bed block.There 									
 is no need to increase the live load below 3m depth.									
									
	As such,the impact allowance for the top 3m of abutments will be 						0.176		
									
									
	For the remaining portion,impact need not be considered.								
									
									
									
4.Wind load:-									
									
	The deck system is located at height of (RTL-LBL)				1.68m				
									
									
	The Wind pressure acting on deck system located at that height is considered for design.								
									
	As per clause 212.3 and from Table .4 of IRC:6---2000,the wind pressure at that 								
	hieght is=								
									
	59.48	Kg/m2.							
									
	Height of the deck system =				1.755				
									
	Breadth of the deck system =				7.4				
									
	The effective area exposed to wind force =HeightxBreadth =								
									
	Hence,the wind force acting at centroid of the deck system =						3.86KN		
	(Taking 50% perforations)								
									
	Further as per clause 212.4 of IRC:6---2000 ,300 Kg/m wind force is considered to be 								
acting at a hieght of 1.5m from road surface on live load vehicle.									
									
	Hence,the wind force acting at 1.5m above the road surface =						18.00KN		
									
									
	The location of the wind force from the top of RCC strip footing =						4.16m		
									
									
									
5.Water current force:-									
									
a)Water current force on deck slab:-									
									
	Velocity of stream at top,when the flow approaches the top of deck slab = √2 x Vmean =						3.65m/sec		
									
	P = 52KV2 =		201.24	Kg/m2.					
									
	(where the value of 'K' is 1.5 )								
									
	Force acting on centroid of deck slab  =			3.80KN					
									
	Point of action of water current force from the top of RCC strip footing = 						3.09m		
b)Water current force on abutment:-									
									
	Water pressure is considered on square ended abutments as per clause 213.2 of 								
IRC:6---2000 is									
									
	For the purpose of calculation of exposed area to water current force,only 1.0m								
width of abutment is considered for full hieght upto HFL									
									
	Hence,the water current force =			3.38KN					
									
									
Point of action of water current force from the top of RCC strip footing = 							2.88m		
									
									
6.Tractive,braking effort of vehicles&frictional resistance of bearings:-									
									
	The breaking effect of vehicles shall be 20% of live load acting in longitudinal 								
direction at 1.2m above road surface as per the clause 214.2 of IRC:6--2000.									
									
	As no bearings are assumed in the present case,50% of the above longitudinal 								
force can be assumed to be transmitted to the supports of simply supported spans resting on 									
stiff foundation with no bearings as per clause 214.5.1.3 of IRC:6---2000									
									
	Hence,the longitudinal force due to braking,tractive or frictional resistance of 								
bearings transferred to abutments is									
			47.84KN						
									
									
	The location of the tractive force from the top of RCC strip footing =						3.86m		
									
									
7.Buoyancy :-									
									
	As per clause 216.4 of IRC:6---2000,for abutments or piers of shallow depth,the 								
dead weight of the abutment shall be reduced by wieght of equal volume of water upto HFL. 									
									
	The above reduction in self wieght will be considered assuming that the back fill 								
behind the abutment is scoured.									
									
	For the preliminary section assumed,the volume of abutment section is								
									
	i)Volume of abutment section   =					6.48Cum			
									
	ii)Volume of top footing   =					2.43Cum			
									
	iii)Volume of 2nd footing   =					2.70Cum			
									
	iv)Volume of 3rd footing   =					2.97Cum			
									
	v)Volume of 4th footing   =					0.00Cum			
						14.58Cum			
									
	Reduction in self wieght =					145.80KN			
									
									
8.Earth pressure :-									
									
	As per clause 217.1 of IRC:6---2000,the abutments are to be designed for a 								
surcharge equivalent to a back fill of hieght 1.20m behind the abutment.									
									
	The coefficient of active earth pressure exerted by the cohesion less back fill on 								
the abutment as per the Coulomb's theory is given by									
									
						 '2			
	Ka =			Sin(a+Q)					
		sina    sin(a-q)  		     sin(Q+q)sin(Q-b)					
				          sin(a+b)					
									
									
									
		Sin(a+Q) =	SIN[3.14*(76.06+30)/180] =		0.961				
		Sin(a-q) =	SIN[3.14*(76.06-15)/180] =		0.875				
		Sina =	SIN[3.14*(76.06)/180] =		0.97				
		Sin(Q+q) =	SIN[3.14*(30+15)/180] =		0.707				
		Sin(Q-b) =	SIN[3.14*(30-0)/180] =		0.5				
		Sin(a+b) =	SIN[3.14*(76.06+0)/180] =		0.97				
									
	From the above expression,								
									
			Ka =	0.3					
									
The hieght of abutment above GL,as per the preliminary section assumed =							1.200m		
									
Hence,maximum pressure at the base of the wall						Pa =	6.48KN/sqm		
									
									
The pressure distribution along the height of the wall is as given below:-									
									
Surcharge load =		6.48	KN/sqm						
									
									
				6.48					
									
									
									
				1.200					
									
									
									
		6.48		6.48					
									
	Area of the rectangular portion =					7.78			
	Area of the triangular portion =					3.89			
						11.67			
									
									
	Taking moments of the areas about the toe of the wall

	2	Triangular	3.89	0.4	1.556				
									
			11.67		6.224				
									
	Height from the bottom of the wall =			0.53m					
									
									
	The active Earth pressure acts on the abutment as shown below:-								
									
									
				0.70					
									
									
									
			15						
					1.200m				
									
						0.53m			
									
			90						
				1.05					
			0						
	Total earth pressure acting on the abutment  P =					69.98KN			
									
									
	Horizontal component of the earth pressure Ph =						67.60KN		
									
									
	Vertical component of the earth pressure Pv =						18.10KN		
									
									
	Eccentricity of vertical component of earth pressure = 						0.53m		
									
9.Siesmic force :-									
									
	As per clause 222.1 of IRC:6---2000,the bridges in siesmic zones I and II need not be 								
designed for siesmic forces.The location of the slab culvert is in Zone-I.Hence,there is no need to 									
design the bridge for siesmic forces.									
									
10.Water pressure force:-									
									
	As per clause 7.11.2.2(b) of IRC SP82:2007,the pressure due to static head will be zero at the surface of 								
water and will increase linearly to P = wh at depth 'h' from the surface, below which it will be constant as indicated 									
in the sketch below :-									
	Where, w = unit weight of water 								
	            h = afflux or depth of superstructure (including wearing coat) whichever is more.								
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
	Total horizontal water pressure force = 				11.48KN				
	The above pressure acts at height of 0.42H =				0.71m				
									
11.Pressure due to eddies :-									
									
Pressure due to eddies = w (Vv-V)2 									
		2g							
Where,									
Vv = velocity of flow through the vents,  									
V = velocity of approach									
(w = unit weight of water; g= Acceleration due to gravity)									
									
	Pressure force due to eddies =				0.007KN				
									
	which is negligible.Hence it need not be considered								
									
12. Pressure due to friction of water against piers and bottom of slab :-									
									
	Pressure due to friction =f x ρ x (Cx Vv)2 								
									
	Where,								
	 f = friction coefficient = 1 								
	ρ = mass density of water (w/g)								
	Vv = velocity of flow through the vents (m/sec)								
	C = value of constant generally taken as10%								
									
i)Force due to friction on Deck slab:-									
									
	Frictional force on bottom and top of deck slab =				4.96KN				
									
	The location of the frictional force from the top of RCC strip footing =						3.09m		
									
ii)Force due to friction on abutment:-									
									
	Frictional force on the canal side face of abutment =				0.50KN				
									
	The location of the frictional force from the top of RCC strip footing =						1.50m		
									
									
									
13. Force due to uplift under superstructure :-									
									
	This force acts vertically upwards and is given by								
									
	Uplift force = wh x Asp 								
									
	Where,								
	Asp area of the superstructure in plan								
	h = the uplift head under the deckslab which may be taken as higher of the following two values:  (i) Afllux								
	(ii) Thickness of superstructure including wearing coat-head loss due to increase in								
	velocity through vents (Vv) Head loss due to increase in velocity through the vents is calculated by 								
	following expression								
		h1 =  Vv2-V2 							
		2g							
									
	Where,								
	Vv =velocity of flow through the vents 								
	V = velocity of approach								
									
		Afflux  =			0.131m				
									
		Head loss due to increase in velocity =			0.012m				
									
		Hence,up lift head =			0.543m				
									
	Hence uplift force on the deck slab =				195.48KN				
									
									
IV)Check for stresses for abutments&footings:-									
									
									
a)Load Envelope-I:-(The Canal is dry,back fill scoured with live load on span)									
									
i)On top of RCC Strip footing									
									
The following co-ordinates are assumed:-

	The footing has to be designed as strip footing supporting the masonry structure								
									
	The net bearing pressure on the toe of footing =				159.66	KN/Sqm			
	(Excluding self weight of footing)								
									
	The footing needs to be designed for 1.5 times the 								
	above net bearing pressure				239.49	KN/Sqm			
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
									
	The UDL on the footing for unit width =				239.49	KN/m			
									
	The critical section for bending is at a distance of 1/4xwidth of bottom footing from the centre,ie,at section X--X								
									
	Hence,the length of cantilever portion to be considered for design = 								
									
						0.83m			
									
	Hence,the critical bending moment = (1/2)Wl2 =					82.49KN-m			
									
									
	Effective depth required d =			Mu/0.133fckb   =		157.51mm			
									
									
	The over all depth required(Assuming 16mm dia bars) =					215.51mm			
									
									
	However provide overall depth of  =					450.00mm			
									
	Hence,effective depth =					392.00mm			
									
									
	Bottom steel:-								
									
	Mu/bd2 =	0.537							
									
	From table 3 of SP 16,percentage of steel required =					0.156			
									
									
	Area of steel required =					611.52sqmm			
									
									
	Hence provide 12mm dia bars at 125mm c/c along width,the area of reinforcement comes to								
									
						904.32sqmm			
	Distribution steel:-								
									
	Provide distribution reinforcement of 0.15% of cross sectional area of footing								
									
	Hence,the distribution reinforcement required =					675.00sqmm			
									
	Adopting 12mm dia bars,the spacing required = 					167.00mm			
									
									
	However provide 12mm dia bars at 150mm c/c spacing,as distribution reinforcement								
									
									
	Check for one way shear:-								
									
		The critical section for beam shear is at distance of 'd' from the face of the column,ie,at Y-Y							
									
	Hence,the factored design shear force  VFd =				35.92KN				
									
									
	Nominal shear stress Tv  =			0.1N/sqmm	<2.8 N/sqmm				
					(As per Table 20 of 1S 456)				
									
		Hence,the section is safe from shear point of view							
									
									
		Assumed percentage area of the steel reinforcement =				0.23%			
									
									
		The design shear strength of concrete for the above steel percentage from 							
		Table 19 of IS 456 is 							
				0.35	Hence Vuc =	137.20KN			
									
				0.35>0.1					
									
			Hence,the depth provided is safe from beam shear point of view						
									
	The check for two way shear is not necessary in the present context.
